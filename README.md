This repository is dedicated for the python code in visualising the historical rainfall pattern, spatial pattern and the flooding hotspot in Kuching city, Sarawak based on the data collected for decades from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, Sarawak. &#128187;

### Example of Visualisation from Rainfall_data.ipynb.
